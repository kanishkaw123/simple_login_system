# simple-login-system
I  wrote this code as my first project- A Simple Login system. When running this code , first it ask whether the client is registered or not. If the client says "YES" it will ask for login information. If client says "NO" then the code will ask for client's email address for registration. Once the client entered the email address , the code check that email throughout the database to make sure that email is not already registered. If the Email is not found the client can continue the registration. Otherwise, code will ask the client if he/she wants to register with a new email. Once client have successfully entered the email he/she can continue with the login process. Throughout this process new client has to use a unique username that doesn't exist on the system. Also, the client has to use a password with minimum of one capital letter, a special character and a number . After those steps client can submit the data to the database and then client will be given his/her unique ID .
